DMS/SMK - A concept application which should serve Red Cross-like organisations as a helpful tool to ease the pain of organizing blood donation events / blood drives.

It allows the administrators to add and edit donors, to add donations for a selected donation event, to view donating history, places that they have donated, etc.
It also enables the admins to add new events, manage them, check their stats, check gathered donations, etc. 

It also comes with a neat visualization module that uses Google Charts to render SVG charts, that enables the admins to see where their donors have donated the most, to check current blood supplies, etc.
